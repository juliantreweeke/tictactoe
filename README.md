# Tic Tac Toe

This is my first project for General Assemblies Web-Dev Immersive BootCamp.

## Features

__Custom Board Sizes:__

A board size of 3x3 up to a horrendous 249x249 can be used.
Anything 250 and above breaks the code and crashes the browser.
The conditions for winning the game are the same for any board size.

__Custom Player Name:__

You can customize player names.

__Random Colour Scheme Setting:__

When turned on, this randomly toggles between different colour schemes.

### Libraries.

I used jQuery in this project.

### Bugs.
Some of the css is messy and the popup positioning is incorrect.

### Final thoughts.

If I did this project again I would focus on a plan early on and keep my code cleaner.
The custom board size feature took a lot longer then expected and I would have liked to focus on the visual design of the game more but I ran out of time.

### Thanks.
Bigups and props to the mofo don Luke Hammer for helping me with the custom board size square shrinking.

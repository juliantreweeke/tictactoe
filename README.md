# Tic Tac Toe

My first Javascript project.
This was an experiment of what I could extend on the simple game of knoughts and crosses.

## Features

__Custom Board Sizes:__

A board size of 3x3 up to a horrendous 249x249 can be used.
Anything 250 and above breaks the code and crashes the browser.

__Custom Player Name:__

You can customize player names.

__Random Colour Scheme:__

Turned on this randomly toggles between different colour schemes.

### Bugs!
Some of the css is messy and the popup positioning is incorrect.

### Final thoughts.

If I did this project again I would focus on a plan early on and keep my code cleaner.
The custom board size feature took a lot longer then expected and I would have liked to focus on the visual design of the game more but I ran out of time.

### Thanks.
Bigups and props to the mofo don Luke Hammer for helping me with the custom board size square shrinking.
